## Advanced Natural Language Processing

- The command for running the python script to train the Transformer Based Model for Machine Translation
    > python3 train.py
    - This saves the model to "transformer_model.pt" which can then be loaded directly to evaluate the performance of the model.

- The command for running the python script to evaluate the model on test data
    > python3 test.py
    - This outputs the file 'testbleu.txt' which contains sentence wise bleu and rouge scores for the test data

- The data is saved in 'dataset' folder in the same directory as the python files.
- Analysis of performance of different models is present in the Report.
- The pretrained model ".pt" files are uploaded on one drive
